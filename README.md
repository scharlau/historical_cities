# Historical Cities 

This is a Rails app based on the Urban Spatial Data from 3700BC to 2000AD found at https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/urbanspatial-hist-urban-pop-3700bc-ad2000 

The goal is to explore how we might use this dataset to develop increasingly better versions of a web application. There are 10300+ records in the dataset.

#Version 1
Use the Creek gem to import the spreadsheet using rake. https://github.com/pythonicrubyist/creek 
Everything goes into one table, which we can manipulate accordinly to show us interesting visualisations.
